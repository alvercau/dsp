[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>**The question:** The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability. Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

>**Code:**
```python
random_sample = np.random.random(1000)
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(random_sample, label='random numbers')
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Random number', ylabel = 'PMF')

cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(random_sample, label='random numbers')
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Random number', ylabel = 'CDF')
```
>In the plot of the PMF, each random number has the same probability, which is expected given the way random.random works. The plot of the CDF confirms this: we get a more or less straight line, which corresponds to a uniform distribution.
